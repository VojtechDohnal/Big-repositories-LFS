Git compresses and stores full versions of the files by default
- solution: Git sparse checkout option â€“ choosing which parts of a repository to include in your local working directory
-	- this is done using the following commands: 
-	       Clone the entire repository: git clone
-	       Enable the sparse checkout feature: git config core.sparsecheckout true
-	       Specify which folders to include, excluding asset folders:
-	       echo src/ > .git/info/sparse-checkout
-	       Load the specified tree: git read-tree -m -u HEAD
- another way: using the garbage collection git gc which turns loose objects into a single file
- another way: using submodules - that is a repository inside another repository, where the inside repository contains the non-text files 
- another strategy is using the Git LFS extension which is specifically designed to handle large files
